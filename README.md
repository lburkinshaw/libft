# libft
## Recoding functions from the C standard library to be used throughout my Hive studies

This was the first project I completed as part of my studies at Hive Helsinki. It duplicates many of the basic functions of C libraries, including string and memory manipulation. 
This library acts as a fundamental building block for more complex projects that follow.

As I have progressed through the curriculum, I have made the following additions:
- ft_printf
- get_next_line
